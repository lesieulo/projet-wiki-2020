The '''little hermit''' (''Phaethornis longuemareus'') is a [[hummingbird]] that is a resident breeder in north-eastern [[Venezuela]], northern [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]] and [[Trinidad]]. This [[lowland]] species occurs in various semi-open wooded habitats, e.g. [[mangrove]], [[secondary forest]], [[plantations]] and [[Scrubland|scrub]]. In Trinidad it also occurs in [[rainforest]]. It is fairly common in most of its range, and therefore listed as [[Least Concern]] by [[BirdLife International]].

Previously, several other small [[hermit (hummingbird)|hermit]]s were considered [[subspecies]] of this [[species]]. This includes the [[stripe-throated hermit]] (''P. striigularis'') of [[Central America]] and north-western [[South America]], the [[minute hermit]] (''P. idaliae'') of south-eastern [[Brazil]], the [[Tapajós hermit]] (''P. aethopyga'') of south-eastern [[Amazon biome|Amazonia]], and the [[black-throated hermit]] (''P. atrimentalis'') of western Amazonia. As presently defined, the little hermit is [[monotypic]].

It is among the smallest [[hummingbird]]s and birds overall with a total length of ca. 9&nbsp;cm. (3½ in) and a weight of 2½-3½ g. (0,08-0,12 oz).<ref>Wood, The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats. Sterling Pub Co Inc. (1983), {{ISBN|978-0-85112-235-9}}</ref> It is olive-green above with orange-[[ochre|ochraceous]] uppertail [[covert (feather)|coverts]] and underparts (the belly often is greyer). As most other [[hermit (hummingbird)|hermit]]s, it has a long decurved bill, elongated central [[rectrices]] with whitish tips and a blackish mask bordered by a whitish-[[Buff (colour)|buff]] [[Cheek|malar]] and [[supercilium]]. The upper mandible is black, the lower is yellow with a black tip. The male has a slightly darker throat than the female.

The males form communal [[Lek (animal behavior)|lek]]s where they sing and flash their tails to attract the females. The song varies over its range, but typically is high, squeaky, complex and repeated again and again.

The little hermit lays two [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] in a conical [[bird nest|nest]] suspended under a large leaf. [[Avian incubation|Incubation]] and [[Fledge|fledging period]] not reported, but probably as relatives where incubations is 14–16 days, and fledging another 20–23 days.

The food of this species is [[nectar]], taken from a wide variety of flowers (e.g. ''[[Heliconia]]''), and some small [[insects]]. It feeds mainly by [[trap-lining]].
