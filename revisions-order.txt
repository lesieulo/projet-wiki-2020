------------------------------------

4. Verbs are conjugated to show only tenses, of which there are two: the present and the past. The present tense in Japanese serves the function of the simple present, the continuous present, the habitual present, and the future tense, while the past tense in Japanese serves the function of the simple past tense, the present perfect and the  past perfect tense. The exact meaning is determined from the context.

5. Adjectives are inflected to show the present, past, affirmative and negative.

6. The grammatical function of nouns like possession, direct object, indirect object etc. are indicated by particles, like &quot;wa&quot; and &quot;no&quot; above. Particles play an extremely important function in Japanese.

7. There is a &quot;standard&quot; dialect of Japanese, &quot;hyoujungo&quot;, taught in schools and used on television and in official communications. However, Japanese also has many dramatically different dialects, differing in terms of vocabulary, pitch accent, and in some cases pronunciation. Dialects are generally mutually intelligible, although extremely geographically separated dialects such as the Touhoku and Kyuushuu variants are not. The Ryuukyuu dialects used in and around Okinawa are related to Japanese, but the two are mutually unintelligible.

8. Japanese has many ways to express different levels of politeness, including special verbs, verbs indicating relative status, use of different nouns, etc.

9. The verb desu/da does is not a copula in the western sense of the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In the sentences above, it has played the copulative function of equality, that is: A = B. However a separate function of &quot;to be&quot; is to indicate existence, for which the verbs arimasu/aru and imasu/iru are used for inanimate and animate things respectively.

=== Politeness ===

There are three main language levels in Japanese: the '''plain form''', the simple polite form or '''teinei''' and the advanced polite form or '''keigo'''.

In the Japanese society, most relationships are not equal: one person has a higher level than the other depending upon his job, age or the situation. The lower position person must use a polite form but the higher one can use a familiar form.

The difference between '''honorific''' (&quot;sonkeigo&quot;) and '''humble''' (&quot;kenjougo&quot;) language is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is used when describing the interlocutor and his group. For example, the &quot;san&quot; suffix (approximately meaning &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot;) is an example of honorific language. It should never be used to talk about oneself.  Nor should it be employed when talking about someone from one's own company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's &quot;group&quot;. The difference between honorific and humble language is especially noticeable in polite speech (&quot;keigo&quot;).

=== Example Basic Japanese Sentence structure ===

Note the importance of the particles, verb tenses, and adjectives.

The '''Japanese language''' is very different from [[English language|English]] and most other [[European languages]].  Like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Korean language|Korean]], Japanese is an [[agglutinative language]], with two (phonologically distinctive) tones like [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbian/Croatian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].  It is a language where sentences need no subject and adjectives can have past tenses. It is of uncertain affiliation, though there are theories that it is related to E. Asian languages such as Korean (but not Chinese), though phonological and lexical similarities to Malayo-Polynesian languages have also been noted. 

=== The Japanese Writing System ===

Written Japanese uses four different scripts: ''Romaji'', ''Hiragana'', ''Katakana'', and ''Kanji''.
'''[[Romaji]]''' refers to the [[Roman alphabet]] and is the writing system that will be used here.

Full-blown Japanese text is typically written in a combination of the other three: [[Kanji]], which is an adaptation of Chinese [[ideogram]]s, and [[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]], which are [[syllabary|syllabaries]]. Although Roman letters are not typically used to write Japanese, wholesale borrowing of English and other western loan words can include their foreign spelling. Also, important acronyms, such as 'NATO' and 'WTO' are written alphabetically.

Here is word &quot;I&quot; in [[hiragana]], [[kanji]] and [[romaji]]:

[[image:pismo_japonskie_sample_small.png]]

N.B. There are two main systems for the romanization of Japanese, known as Kunrei and Hepburn. The Kunrei system is little used outside of Japan, as it is difficult for non-Japanese-speakers to decipher. However, it is slighty briefer than the Hepburn system, and is therefore generally used for keyboard input of Japanese on computer systems. The word for &quot;I&quot; is written &quot;watashi&quot; according to the Hepburn system, and &quot;watasi&quot; in the Kunrei romanization.

=== Pronunciation ===

The Japanese sound system, for the purpose of native literacy, is expressed in terms of syllables rather than isolated vowels or consonants.  This is because written Japanese possesses two syllabaries, not an alphabet, in which each character represents a syllable (though some characters represent only one vowel). Any Japanese syllable can be written in Hiragana or Katakana, the two syllabaries, or in Romaji, as shown below.

=== Japanese Syllabary in Romaji ===

Basic Syllables: Vowel, Consonant plus vowel and &quot;n&quot;.

N.B. Japanese vowels are pure sounds like their [[Italian language|Italian]] counterparts.
Japanese /u/, however is unrounded.

&lt;/pre&gt;

                                                                     
Modified Syllables:  Consonant plus basic vowel
&lt;pre&gt;

    g         ga     gi    gu    ge    go
    z         za     ji    zu    ze    zo             N.B. ji

    p         pa     pi    pu    pe    po

&lt;/pre&gt;
Modified Syllables: Consonant plus ya, yu, yo, or palatalized consonants.
&lt;pre&gt;

    k         kya          kyu         kyo
    s         sha          shu         sho            N.B. sha, shu,sho

                                                           between the English
                                                           &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l.&quot;

    p         pya          pyu         pyo
&lt;/pre&gt;


Double (Geminate) Consonants:  length of two syllables
&lt;pre&gt;

  kk -  preceded by a glottal stop and held for 2 syllables.
  pp -  preceded by a glottal stop and held for 2 syllables.
  ss -  preceded by a glottal stop and held for 2 syllables.
  tt -  preceded by a glottal stop and held for 2 syllables.

&lt;/pre&gt;

(Note: the so-called 'doubled' consonants often involve the glottis in speech, but may not necessarily be a full glottal stop.)

Long Vowels:  length of two syllables
&lt;pre&gt;

  aa -  same as &quot;a&quot; but held an extra syllable.
  ii -  same as &quot;i&quot; but held an extra syllable.
  uu -  same as &quot;u&quot; but held an extra syllable.
  ei -  same as &quot;e&quot; but held an extra syllable.
  ou -  same as &quot;o&quot; but held an extra syllable.

&lt;/pre&gt;

In romaji, long vowels may be indicated by either a macron (bar over the vowel), circumflex, additional vowel to match the Japanese orthography, or not at all: &quot;Tokyo&quot; is really &quot;Toukyou&quot; in Japanese.

Note that &quot;e&quot; is normally doubled by the addition of &quot;i&quot; rather than an extra e. Likewise, &quot;o&quot; is usually doubled by &quot;u&quot;. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule, such as the word for &quot;big&quot; (&quot;&amp;#22823;&quot;) which is lengthened by an &quot;o&quot; as in &quot;ookii&quot;

The letter &quot;n&quot; is both a syllable in itself and the leading consonant in some other syllables. Written out in kana, there is no ambiguity, because each kana is a single distinct character. To prevent ambiguity in romaji, when the syllabic &quot;n&quot; is followed by a vowel, it is often separated from the vowel by an apostrophe.


=== Pronunciation: Features ===

1. In English, stressed syllables in a word are pronounced louder and longer.
In Japanese, all syllables, with a few exceptions, are pronounced with equal length and loudness.
&lt;p&gt;
2. In Japanese, a stressed syllable is merely pronounced at a higher pitch.  This is part of the Japanese intonation pattern. 
&lt;p&gt;
3. Japanese does have a distinct intonation pattern.  Their intonation pattern can be heard not only in individual words, but also in whole sentences.  Intonation is produced by a rise and fall in pitch over certain syllables.  In the case of questions, the Japanese intonation patterns bear little resemblance to the English ones.  This is a source of a lot of confusion.


=== Example: What typical Japanese syllables look like ===

A typical exchange between two people would look like this:
Mr. Hayashi introduces Mr. Tanaka to Mr. '''Sanger'''.

&lt;pre&gt;
Yamada:   Tanaka-san, kochira wa, Senga-san desu.
Senga:    Hajimemashite, Senga desu. Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.
Tanaka:   Hajimemashite. ABC no Tanaka desu. Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.
Yamada:   Senga-san, Nupiidia no kaishain desu.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

Yamda:    Mr. Tanaka, this is Mr. Sanger.
Sanger:   How do you do. My name is Sanger. I'm very glad to meet you.
Tanaka:   How do you do. I am Mr. Tanaka from ABC Company. I'm very glad to meet you.
Yamda:    Mr. Sanger is of an employee of Nupedia.
&lt;/pre&gt;


=== Writing System ===


The preceding conversation could  be written in a mix of Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Content roots of words would be written in Kanji, the partially pictographic and iconic logograms/morphograms that the Japanese borrowed from the Chinese.

Particles marking parts of speech, like &quot;wa&quot;, and &quot;o&quot; and verb inflections would be spelled out syllable by syllable in Hiragana, one of the two Japanese syllabaries. Many everyday spoken words, if written down, are also written using hiragana instead of the kanji.

Hiragana is also used to spell out words which have particularly complex kanji, when writing for younger children or foreigners who have limited knowledge of kanji, or when displaying text on character-cell displays.
Foreign words like &quot;Sanger,&quot; &quot;Nupedia&quot; would be spelled out syllable by syllable in Katakana, the second Japanese syllabary, which is most often used to write loan words of non-Chinese origin (the relationship of Chinese to Japanese is somewhat like French to English, except Chinese is not at all related to Japanese).

=== Grammar: Features ===

1. The basic sentence structure of a Japanese sentence is
      TOPIC: PARTICLE: COMMENT.
      For example:
      Kochira wa,  Senga-san desu.
      Kochira is the topic of the sentence, indicated by the particle &quot;wa.&quot;
      This means &quot;as for this person.&quot;
      The verb is &quot;desu&quot; meaning 'is.'
      &quot;Senga-san desu&quot; is the comment.
      Therefore, this loosely translates to:
      &quot;As for this person, (it) is Mr. Sanger.&quot;   

Japanese, like Chinese, is often called a 'topic prominent' language, which means it marks topic separately from subject, and the two do not always coincide. 

2. Japanese nouns usually have neither number nor gender. Thus &quot;hon&quot; meaning &quot;book&quot; can be used for the singular or plural. However, in the case of certain native words (of proto-Japanese rather than Chinese origin) plurality is indicated by reduplication. For example, &quot;hito&quot; means &quot;person&quot; whilst &quot;hitobito&quot; means &quot;people&quot;; &quot;ware&quot; means &quot;I&quot; whilst &quot;wareware&quot; means &quot;we&quot;.

3. [[Subject Object Verb|Verbs normally come at the end of a sentence]].

4. Verbs are conjugated to show only tenses, of which there are two: the present and the past. The present tense in Japanese serves the function of the simple present, the continuous present, the habitual present, and the future tense, while the past tense in Japanese serves the function of the simple past tense, the present perfect and the  past perfect tense. The exact meaning is determined from the context.

5. Adjectives are inflected to show the present, past, affirmative and negative.

6. The grammatical function of nouns like possession, direct object, indirect object etc. are indicated by particles, like &quot;wa&quot; and &quot;no&quot; above. Particles play an extremely important function in Japanese.

7. There is a &quot;standard&quot; dialect of Japanese, &quot;hyoujungo&quot;, taught in schools and used on television and in official communications. However, Japanese also has many dramatically different dialects, differing in terms of vocabulary, pitch accent, and in some cases pronunciation. Dialects are generally mutually intelligible, although extremely geographically separated dialects such as the Touhoku and Kyuushuu variants are not. The Ryuukyuu dialects used in and around Okinawa are related to Japanese, but the two are mutually unintelligible.

8. Japanese has many ways to express different levels of politeness, including special verbs, verbs indicating relative status, use of different nouns, etc.

9. The verb desu/da does is not a copula in the western sense of the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In the sentences above, it has played the copulative function of equality, that is: A = B. However a separate function of &quot;to be&quot; is to indicate existence, for which the verbs arimasu/aru and imasu/iru are used for inanimate and animate things respectively.

=== Politeness ===

There are three main language levels in Japanese: the '''plain form''', the simple polite form or '''teinei''' and the advanced polite form or '''keigo'''.

In the Japanese society, most relationships are not equal: one person has a higher level than the other depending upon his job, age or the situation. The lower position person must use a polite form but the higher one can use a familiar form.

The difference between '''honorific''' (&quot;sonkeigo&quot;) and '''humble''' (&quot;kenjougo&quot;) language is particularly pronounced in the Japanese language. Humble language is used to talk about oneself or one's own group (company, family) whilst honorific language is used when describing the interlocutor and his group. For example, the &quot;san&quot; suffix (approximately meaning &quot;Mr.&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot; or &quot;Ms.&quot;) is an example of honorific language. It should never be used to talk about oneself.  Nor should it be employed when talking about someone from one's own company to an external person, since the company is the speaker's &quot;group&quot;. The difference between honorific and humble language is especially noticeable in polite speech (&quot;keigo&quot;).

=== Example Basic Japanese Sentence structure ===

Note the importance of the particles, verb tenses, and adjectives.

Mr. '''Sanger''' and Mr. '''Wales''' eat at a Japanese restaurant.

=== Japanese Pronunciation and Writing Systems ===



Japanese uses four different writing systems: ''Romaji'', ''Hiragana'', ''Katakana'', and ''Kanji''.

'''Romaji''' refers to the [[Roman alphabet]] and is the writing system that will be used here.

Traditional Japanese is written in a combination of the other three: [[Kanji]], which is an adaptation of Chinese [[ideogram]]s, and [[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]], which are [[syllabary|syllabaries]].



=== Pronunciation ===



The Japanese sound systems is expressed in terms of syllables rather than individual vowels or consonants.  This is because Japanese possesses a syllabary, not an alphabet, in which each character represents a syllable.  Each of the Japanese syllables can be written in Hiragana or Katakana, the two syllabaries, or in Romaji, as shown below.



=== Japanese Syllabary in Romaji ===



Basic Syllables: Vowel, Consonant plus vowel and &quot;n&quot;.

&lt;pre&gt;

                                                             are pure sounds like

                                                             their Italian counterparts.

=== Pronunciation: Features ===



1. In English, stressed syllables in a word are pronounced louder and longer.

In Japanese, all syllables, with a few exceptions, are pronounced with equal length and loudness.

&lt;p&gt;

2. In Japanese, a stressed syllable is merely pronounced at a higher pitch.  This is part of the Japanese intonation pattern. 

&lt;p&gt;

3. Japanese does have a distinct intonation pattern.  Their intonation pattern can be heard not only in individual words, but also in whole sentences.  Intonation is produced by a rise and fall in pitch over certain syllables.  In the case of questions, the Japanese intonation pattern bears no relation to the English one.  This is a source of a lot of confusion.





=== Example: What typical Japanese syllables look like ===



A typical exchange between two people would look like this:

Mr. Hayashi introduces Mr. Tanaka to Mr. '''Sanger'''.



&lt;pre&gt;

Yamada:   Tanaka-san, kochira wa, Senga-san desu.

Senga:    Hajimemashite, Senga desu. Doozo yoroshiku.

Tanaka:   Hajimemashite. ABC no Tanaka desu. Doozo yoroshiku.

Yamada:   Senga-san, Nupiidia no kaishain desu.

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;



Yamda:    Mr. Tanaka, this is Mr. Sanger.

Sanger:   How do you do. My name is Sanger. I?m very glad to meet you.

Tanaka:   How do you do. I am Mr. Tanaka from ABC Company. I'm very glad to meet 

                  you.

Yamda:    Mr. Sanger is of an employee of Nupedia.

&lt;/pre&gt;





=== Writing System ===





The preceding conversation would typically be written in Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.

Roots of words would be written in Kanji, the traditional Japanese ideograms that

the Japanese borrowed from the Chinese.  Particles, like &quot;wa&quot; and &quot;o&quot; and verb inflections would be spelled out syllable by syllable in Hiragana, one of the two Japanese syllabaries.  Hiragana is also used to spell out words which have particularly complex kanji, or when writing for younger children or foreigners who have limited knowledge of kanji.  Foreign words like &quot;Sanger,&quot; &quot;Nupedia&quot; would be spelled out syllable by syllable in Katakana, the second Japanese syllabary.



=== Grammar: Features ===



1. The basic sentence structure of a Japanese sentence is

      TOPIC: PARTICLE: COMMENT.

      For example:

      Kochira wa,  Senga-san desu.

      Kochira is the topic of the sentence, indicated by the particle &quot;wa.&quot;

      This means &quot;as for this person.&quot;

      The verb is &quot;desu&quot; meaning 'is.'

      &quot;Senga-san desu&quot; is the comment.

      Therefore, this loosely translates to:

      &quot;As for this person, (it) is Mr. Sanger.&quot;   



2. Japanese nouns have neither number nor gender. Thus &quot;hon&quot; meaning &quot;book&quot; can be used for the singular or plural.



3. Verbs normally come at the end of a sentence.



4. Verbs are conjugated to show only tenses, of which there are two: the present and the past.The present tense in Japanese serves the function of the simple present, the continuous present, the habitual present, and the future tense, while the past tense in Japanese serves the function of the simple past tense, the present perfect and the  past perfect tense.  The exact meaning is determined from the context.



5. Adjectives, are inflected to show the present, past, affirmative and negative.



6. The grammatical function of nouns like possession, direct object, indirect object etc. are indicated by particles, like &quot;wa&quot; and &quot;no&quot; above. Particles play an extremely important function in Japanese.



7. Japanese has many different dialects which change pronunciation dramatically.



8. Japanese has many ways to express different levels of politeness, including special verbs, verbs indicating relative status, use of different nouns, etc.



9. The verb desu/da does is not a copula in the western sense of the verb &quot;to be&quot;. In the sentences above, it has played the copulative function of equality, that is: A = B. However a separate function of &quot;to be&quot; is to indicate existence, for which the verbs arimasu/ari and imasu/iru are used for inaninmate and animate things respectively.



=== Example Basic Japanese Sentence structure ===



Note the importance of the particles, verb tenses, and adjectives.



Mr. '''Sanger''' and Mr. '''Wales''' eat at a Japanese restaurant.





&lt;pre&gt;

Senga:     Sumimasen, menyuu o misete kudasai.  Please show us the menu.

Ueitoresu: Hai, doozo.                          Certainly sir. Here you are.

           Nomimono wa nani ga  ii desu ka.     What would you like to drink? 

Weruzu:    Biiru ga, hoshii desu.               I like beer.

Senga:     Sukiyaki ga, ii desu                 I'll have the &quot;sukiyaki.&quot;                  

Weruzu:    Biiru o 2-hon to sukiyaki o kudasai. Two bottles of beer and some

                                                sukiyaki, please. 

Senga:     Dezaato wa, meron ga ii desu.        For dessert we'll have melon.

      <text bytes="10736" xml:space="preserve">The '''Japanese language''' is very different from [[English language|English]] and most other [[European languages]].  Like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Korean language|Korean]], Japanese is an agglutinating language, with two (phonologically distinctive) tones like [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbian/Croatian]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].  It is a language where sentences need no subject and adjectives can have past tenses.  The most useful approach to Japanese study is to consider that the Japanese language has its own internal logic, its own way of communicating, and not compare it with your own language, but accept and learn it on its own terms.



=== Japanese Pronunciation and Writing Systems ===



Japanese uses four different writing systems: ''Romaji'', ''Hiragana'', ''Katakana'', and ''Kanji''.

'''Romaji''' refers to the [[Roman alphabet]] and is the writing system that will be used here.

Traditional Japanese is written in a combination of the other three: [[Kanji]], which is an adaptation of Chinese [[ideogram]]s, and [[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]], which are [[syllabary|syllabaries]].



=== Pronunciation ===



The Japanese sound systems is expressed in terms of syllables rather than individual vowels or consonants.  This is because Japanese possesses a syllabary, not an alphabet, in which each character represents a syllable.  Each of the Japanese syllables can be written in Hiragana or Katakana, the two syllabaries, or in Romaji, as shown below.



=== Japanese Syllabary in Romaji ===



Basic Syllables: Vowel, Consonant plus vowel and &quot;n&quot;.

&lt;pre&gt;



               a     i     u     e     o                     N.B. Japanese vowels

                                                             are pure sounds like

                                                             their Italian counterparts.
